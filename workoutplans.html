                        Engage your core and keep your chest lifted and back flat as you shift your weight into your heels, push your hips back, and bend your knees lower into a squat.
                        Bend your elbows and bring your palms together in front of your chest. (You can also just hold your hands in front of your chest the entire time.)
                        Drive through your heels to stand and squeeze your glutes at the top for 1 rep.</p>

                        Engage your core and keep your chest lifted and back flat as you shift your weight into your heels; push your hips back and bend your knees to lower into a squat.
                        Come back upright, and use the momentum to bring your left knee in toward your chest. Crunch down toward your knee and twist your torso to the left so that your right elbow taps your left knee. Bring your knee down, and bring your hands back to the starting position.
                        Squat down again, and repeat the oblique twist on the other side. This is 1 rep.</p>

                        Jump up into the air as high as you can and straighten out your legs. Swing your arms down by your sides for momentum, and keep your back straight and chest lifted.
                        Land back on the floor with soft knees. This is 1 rep. Go directly into another squat.</p>

                        As you stand, bring your right foot behind your left leg, placing it down diagonally and behind you.
                        Bend both knees and sink into a curtsy squat, keeping your hips tucked and core engaged.
                        Return to your starting position and do another squat, then repeat the curtsy lunge on the other side. This is 1 rep. Continue alternating..</p>

                        Intermediate: Superset the presses by doing the dumbbell front raise for 10 reps immediately after your set is finished. The 1-2 punch will have your shoulders really burning.
                        Expert: Try one arm at a time. Be sure to lighten the dumbbells slightly at first as this will really challenge your core in a big way...</p>
